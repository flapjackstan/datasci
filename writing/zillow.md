# Zillow Offers

Answer the following questions in at most 5 sentences per part (i.e., at most 10 sentences in total):


### A. According to the articles, why did Zillow's home buying venture fail?

- An issue with iBuying that Kiger addressed in the flip flop article was that there is a fair amount of risk in putting too much trust in a model, especially without double checking underlying domain principles.

- Along a similar line as above, information asymmetry played a large factor in the interaction between the seller and the buyer; meaning that the sellers had knowledge that the buyers did not have and could not account for.

- Given above, in the model that Zillow was using to determine what price to pay for a home, there was a lack of some variables listed in the article such as: noise levels, neighborhood maintenance, architecture, etc.


### B. Suppose you work at Zillow, and they want to try getting into "instant buying" again, having learned from past mistakes.  Either suggest a strategy for doing this differently or describe how you would convince them that this is a fundamentally flawed idea that cannot be done successfully.

- A better strategy to approach iBuying would be to use the Zillow models, as previously used, and contract a local inspector and or a real estate agent in the area to provide a home inspection report for the property.

- I would also recommed, as Amit Seru had mentioned in the article, not to put blind faith in machine learning models and to apply a layer of common sense to the study being done.

- I would additionally recommend to hire outside consultants to review the concept and project to ensure there was less bias in Zillow's efforts to bring in this new method of purchasing homes.
