# Zillow Offers

Answer the following questions in at most 5 sentences per part (i.e., at most 10 sentences in total):


### A. According to the articles, why did Zillow's home buying venture fail?

- An issue with iBuying that Kiger addressed in the flip flop article was that there is a fair amount of risk in putting too much trust in a model, especially without double checking underlying domain principles.

- Along a similar line as above, information asymmetry played a large factor in the interaction between the seller and the buyer


### B. Suppose you work at Zillow, and they want to try getting into "instant buying" again, having learned from past mistakes.  Either suggest a strategy for doing this differently or describe how you would convince them that this is a fundamentally flawed idea that cannot be done successfully.

- A better strategy to approach iBuying would be to use the Zillow models, as previously used, and contract a local inspector in the area to provide a home inspection report for the property.
