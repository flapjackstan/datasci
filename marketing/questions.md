# Description

Services (vs. products) have been one of the fastest growing sectors of the business marketplace, driving the "experience economy." In this session we will discuss the differences inherent in marketing services vs. products. The Allianz case, and the company's move to a more customer-centric orientation to selling insurance, will be our discussion material.




Should Allianz implement a simplicity strategy across all 70 markets? Why or why not?

One of Allianz's targets is to have an above-market NPS in 75%+ of its markets. Is simplicity the way to get there?

Who benefits the most from simplifying operations? (Please consider all stakeholders, namely employees, executives, customers, agents/brokers, and competitors)

If you were the CEO of Allianz Italy, would you be in favor of the simplicity strategy (see Exhibit 11)? What if you were the CEO of Allianz Germany (see Exhibit 7)? What would worry you the most about the proposed simplicity strategy?



Modern marketing is increasingly linked to rigorous data analysis. Four of the cases featured over the course contain a data component that is integral to decisions to be made in the case. Each student will be randomly assigned to analyze one of these four cases and submit as an individual written analysis. Assignments can be found here. The analysis to be completed varies slightly by case. Questions are provided on Blackboard. Case analysis must be uploaded to Blackboard before the beginning of the class in which the case is to be discussed. Late submissions will not be accepted.
 
The analytics assignment should include the following:
 

    A problem statement that clearly and concisely identifies the problem to be analyzed along with any hypotheses that indicate what decision the outcome might inform
    A brief discussion of your methodology accompanied by relevant summary tables and/or charts from your analysis
    A conclusion that synthesizes your findings into a concise, actionable recommendation suitable for review by a senior executive
    Limitations & caveats of the analysis, including additional data or analysis you would recommend supplementing the findings from your work.

 
You will be graded based on the correctness of your calculations, selection of frameworks utilized to derive your answers, and the synthesis of your findings into a management recommendation. It is important that your recommendation is focused on the data and the relevant topical framework. Students who submit recommendations that are not connected to the core subject matter will not receive full credit (for example, if your assignment is to calculate customer lifetime value by segment to determine where management should focus acquisition efforts, your recommendation should focus on the segments discussed in the case and decision points referenced in the case, rather than imaginary options not included in the case).
 
The analysis should be no more than 1-2 single-spaced pages, excluding exhibits (which can include your charts and tables). You are encouraged to include any spreadsheets or data files that show your calculations and analytical work. Though these attachments are not required, they can sometimes help me understand how you reached the conclusions in your recommendation.
Submit one pdf that includes all of your exhibits and attachments using this link. Be sure to submit your assignment before class starts on the day the case is discussed. Note that the due date listed on Blackboard is the date of the last valid case (Springfield Nor'easters). Your due date may be sooner.



Attached is the rubric used for grading the marketing analytics case write-up. Please adhere to the guidelines in the course syllabus.
One final piece of advice: while this assignment is focused on the use of data in framing marketing decisions, be mindful that the data you present is relevant to the issues to be resolved. Some students like to "show their math", thinking that a higher grade will be achieved by demonstrating a lot of mathematical gymnastics. Try to imagine that you were sending this brief 1-2 page memo to the CEO of your company. They are pressed for time. Show them only the data they need to be convinced of your recommendation. Extraneous inclusion of data in your analysis can actually diminish your grade.
