I believe in living unselfishly and genuinely. I believe that you are in charge of how you react to the people and events in your life. You can either give negativity, power over your life or you can choose happiness instead. Take control and choose to focus on what is important. I live to spread positivity like a disease :)

Nice too meet you, my name is Patrick Lennon and I was born and raised in Venice Beach, CA, part of one of the largest families in L.A., the Lennons.  Our family has been populating Venice since 1904, so you won't find a more local family.  I own and operate three companies, D2 Models, a nationwide modeling agency Klothwork, a distributor and retailer for sweatshirts and t-shirts and finally Book My Lot, an online resource for locating and booking food trucks around the country.  I ended up buying the house I grew up in located right in the heart of Venice to help take care of my mother and now live here with my beautiful wife Cristina.   We've decided to share it with world travelers and allow them to experience a big piece of Venice locality from location, to family, to food and entertainment.  We're extremely family oriented and have hundreds of friends and family around the neighborhood.  We love being social, just kickin' it on the couch with a good home cooked meal,  the company of others, travelling and meeting new people!  I worked in the restaurant industry before starting my companies so I have a great sense of what to see and what to do when in Venice for entertainment.  I work from home, am always here to help and because I am my own boss, I have the freedom to jump on a bike with my guests and show them around town.   We promise you'll love the stay and would much rather it be affordable and fun then expensive and boring!",within a few hours,100%,95%,Venice,3,4,TRUE,FALSE

We are not timid, but pretty adventurous travelers.  The most unusual trip my husband and I had was to backpack in Ghana. 
We  discovered vacation apartment living some years ago in Paris, in the Marais, totally immersed in the neighborhood, no tourists around.  I will never stay in a hotel again, if I can help it. Living where the locals live and to interact with them is a huge part of the experience.  

I was born in Germany and came to California when I was very young.  You might say that I came on a whim, with hardly an idea what I was getting into.  But it all worked out beautifully.   
Renting to vacationers has always been a dream, one might say, it has been on the ""bucket list.""  I have met so many wonderful people, mostly from countries other than the USA and it has been a pleasure to learn about other cultures and customs, as well as share my own ""hybrid"" German/American culture.

I grew up between the Mountains of Colorado, in Vail and Aspen, and a large cattle ranch in Northwest Montana.  After a year of school at Prescott College in Arizona and several more shooting ski films in Colorado, I moved to North Hollywood where I lasted about 6 months before fleeing to Half Moon Bay.  I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.  About 10 years ago I met my sweetheart at the Premier of an IMAX Film called ""Mystery of the Nile"" we shot while making the first ""Source to Sea"" descent of the Nile.  After a couple of years living in the Marina we decided to settle in Topanga with our young family.  As luck would have it, we found a magical piece of property, with direct access to over 100 miles of hiking/mountain biking trails through Topanga State Park and adjacent wild areas, while being only 22 miles direct from downtown Los Angeles.  Now I am able to work closer to home and family.  Airbnb along with some beautiful property with stunning views is helping fulfill that dream....
As far as hosting, I would personally like to make everyone who stays with us a lifelong friend but I am also just happy to share a such a beautiful place so close to the city, yet so far away from all the noise and haste!

I love meeting people from around the world. Our travels have taken us all over America and to more than 20 countries around the globe.  In the late 90’s we lived for about two years in the Dominican Republic.  I have also loved being home, raising my kids, giving parties and opening our California home to friends who have stayed for months on their way to the next stop in their life journey.    AirBnB Hosting offers us an opportunity to bring our passion for meeting people from around the globe and our passion for hospitality together.  We hope we can help make your visit to California a great experience.

I have been an educator in the La Crescenta area for the last 16 years of my life, working with children in the public schools and at my church. Before that I was a television producer in Cleveland, Ohio.  My husband Andy is the busy pastor of a local La Crescenta  church. Part of his ministry includes leading mission teams to the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the Sierras. He speaks Spanish, and I am always learning. My daughter Holly is in and out of town; she often helps us with hosting while she's home in the summer. We are looking forward to our AirBnB adventure with you!

I’m Matt. I would love to make my home available to you on your travels! I love to travel myself and have been quite a few places. When traveling I prefer to stay at a fellow Airbnb hosts property vs a hotel chain. I have always had a wonderful experience, it makes me feel right at home in a new location, plus, it's a really fun and great way to meet new people. 

Bel Air is truly an amazing place to call home: all types of food, wine, entertainment, great schools, amazing real estate and centrally located to all LA has to offer. I love live music, animals, outdoor activities, festivals, beach volleyball and more. I love my family & my friends.

I have just finished remodeling and updating this special little guest unit and private patio and I have done so with a visiting guest in mind - just like you. It is my goal to provide you with lasting memories of your time here in Los Angeles and I will do anything I can to help you achieve just that -  right down to the last little detail, namely:  for those cold mornings there is the towel warmer in your bathroom, for your listening pleasure the Bose Soundlink Mini II bluetooth sound system, for atmosphere we have installed  LED lighting strips carefully positioned throughout,  for your reading pleasure we offer a small yet distinct  collection of great reads all with the great City of Los Angeles showcased as the backdrop to their individual storylines.  In that library you have access to information on interesting things to do and places to see while in our great city, and for your viewing pleasure a brand new 32"" Roku/ SMART TV,  you also will find personalized ""Casa Dino"" stationary. envelopes  and postcards along with complimentary office supplies in your pop down desk/ computer work station, for your security  there is a private laptop safe, we also have a special wall featuring Los Angeles ""themed"" maps of the City and various neighborhoods and to top it all off you will enjoy your complimentary morning coffee experience featuring the Keurig MINI plus Brewing System and an assortment of  K-pods to suit your individual tastes. 
     I have resided in Los Angeles my entire life, so I am a terrific resource when it comes to the history of our City, the layout of the many neighborhoods, off the beaten path things to see or do or even the hottest new restaurant, drinking spot, romantic night out or dance club. You may even prefer to stay in and prepare a meal for yourself in your own newly remodeled private and fully equipped kitchen. Or perhaps take in some sun and read a great book on your own private patio or take a cool dip poolside. It's all good...Being situated in the Hollywood Hills, don't be surprised as you take a stroll, jog or bike  through the neighborhood to spot well-known celebrities across the board from the world's of dance, stage, motion pictures or music industries. After all, this is one of the key areas where they choose to call home. 
     I love cooking and entertaining and I also have a passion for building. I have painstakingly completed most of the renovations to this original 1920's Mediterranean Villa myself and I am so very excited to share it with you.   I have also been in the restaurant and hospitality industry for most of my career, which is why hosting guests such as yourself is such a natural for me.
     So, without further delay,  I say to you...""mi casa, es tu casa,""  Yes, ""my place is your place."" Make that reservation now. I look forward to meeting and hosting you here at  ""Casa Dino'"" an Airbnb 5-Star property!""",within an hour,100%,100%,Hollywood Hills,2,2,TRUE,TRUE

Thanks for checking out my place!   Here's a little bit about me :)  
I guess I'd have to start with my family, my kids, and my husband...they mean the world to me.  I also couldn't live without the beach, wine and laughter!

I'm a big fan of Hunger Games and Outlander series and also enjoy the Janet Evanovich - Stephanie Plum series.   A few of my favorite movies would include Grease and Slapshot.   For TV Shows, Game of Thrones, Jeff Lewis flipping out, Top Chef.  And music wise, I'm a fan of Neil Diamond, Willie Nelson, Gypsy Kings, Litter River Band, GnR, Stones, Cure, Depech Mode, Morrisey. 

As a host, I would want you to feel at home - but I'm not your maid or your  mom - please be respectful and clean up after yourself.  We want people to enjoy the time they spend at our accommodations and to feel comfortable.  A home away from home - or an escape.  I truly believe you'll love my place!

Thank you for taking the time to look at our cozy home, ""Casita Amoroso.""  My name is Barbara, and I am 3rd generation, born and raised in Venice Beach, California.

Katy is a well-known local birth and postpartum doula who clearly loves babies, her family, and sprinkling her personal touches throughout the property. She prides herself in keeping everything clean and organized!

Thank you for visiting our listings for CASA LUNA and BLUE MOON BUNGALOW.

 CASA LUNA features architecture & design elements of all the places we've lived & loved. The Collection of folk art prevalent in its decor is a reflection of our restored 1920's Spanish home In Altadena.

BLUE MOON BUNGALOW is a 1 BR/ 1 Bath 600 sq ft sexy, cool, ultra modern guesthouse that pays homage to Hollywood in it's decor.

Being awarded SUPERHOST each quarter is the best reward and a great incentive to continue exceeding our guests expectations to provide them with a memorable time in our home. 

Kittie was born and bred sassy and smart in the south, energized and enlightened in the Land of Enchantment, rejuvenated and revitalized in Mexico, & self-actualized and sustained in California...
The words Wanderlust & adventuresome could be used to describe her. Her entrepreneurial & creative talents have been used in careers from owning an iconic retail shop in Santa Fe to owning a production company with her son, Whiskey Pete, a well-known vocalist, performer, & composer in Electronic Dance Music. 
Kittie underwent a life -changing cervical fusion surgery in 2013 & was given an opportunity for more life and more love. Her new life chapter began when this airbnb business was born following her long recovery. 

I am so blessed with an amazing life. I've been given children, family and friends that fill me with great contentment. My joy of life is a reflection of all that I  am grateful for and all the lessons I've learned along the way.

Airbnb has afforded me wonderful opportunities to meet people from all over the world and I love it. Who will cross our threshold today?

He was the reason why we eventually left our loft in the arts district behind to build and design  our custom dream home in the hills of echo park. The house has three levels and we live in the two top floors above the air bnb unit. Tino and I have lived in five different countries and have always been passionate about traveling. Our favorite places where we recently spent our vacations at are Tulum and pretty much all over Italy... We love to cook and share food with friends. Tino loves collecting books and vinyl and of course we love watching movies. Lately we have been hooked on the italian directors of I am love/ A Bigger splash (Luca Guadagnino) and The Great Beauty/ Consequences of Love (Paolo Sorrentino)….Yoko loves his Pixar movies such as ‘Coco’ or ’Toy Story’. Meeting new people, exploring new cultures and enjoying life has always been super important and a driving energy for us. We love living in LA...foremost the weather but we also appreciate the chilled vibe of the city. It makes us happy to make others feel comfortable and enjoy our LA home and the city as much as we do!

 I love traveling whether it be for business or pleasure. 
I began hosting in February 2018. 
Animal lover; self-employed for 25 years, working as a CART Captioner; Venice/California Native.  I enjoy a good Cabernet and deep conversations or a good Bourbon & lots of laughs.

Favorite travel destination: Anguilla Lesser Antilles
Paris 
Alaska 
Favorite food: pizza, gnocchi, chicken mole, chilaquiles, refried beans, lobster mac'ncheese, shrimp n grits, monte cristo

I am friendly, courteous, somewhat of a jokester, and truly enjoy meeting people from different walks of life during my travel.

I enjoy hosting because I get excited when  people come to visit  Los Angeles!  It is such a vibrant, eclectic ""kaleidoscope"" city

We are your hosts from nMatter partners, Since the time we have started hosting on Airbnb, its been a wonderful journey, met some wonderful people. We love meeting  people but always give guests the privacy they want.  we want our guests to  enjoy a quality home away from home experience. Guests feedback and reviews are very important as they help me understand their expectations and experiences during their stay. 

Important Note to our guests:  

1. For best experience at our place, please do not wait until your check out to let us know you had some issue. we try our best to be attentive hosts and be available to address any questions/concerns/issues during your stay.

2. We DO NOT have camera's inside of our units, the security camera's are outside (parking lot, yard, patio etc). we totally understand guests concern as we hear so many horrible stories out there. Rest assured guests privacy is our top priority, we do not compromise on that. PLEASE let me know ASAP if you have any concerns, we will address them Immediately.

Thank you to every guest who stayed with us, we look forward to host you.

I grew up between the Mountains of Colorado, in Vail and Aspen, and a large cattle ranch in Northwest Montana.  After a year of school at Prescott College in Arizona and several more shooting ski films in Colorado, I moved to North Hollywood where I lasted about 6 months before fleeing to Half Moon Bay.  I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.  About 10 years ago I met my sweetheart at the Premier of an IMAX Film called ""Mystery of the Nile"" we shot while making the first ""Source to Sea"" descent of the Nile.  After a couple of years living in the Marina we decided to settle in Topanga with our young family.  As luck would have it, we found a magical piece of property, with direct access to over 100 miles of hiking/mountain biking trails through Topanga State Park and adjacent wild areas, while being only 22 miles direct from downtown Los Angeles.  Now I am able to work closer to home and family.  Airbnb along with some beautiful property with stunning views is helping fulfill that dream....

Thank you for taking an interest in me and viewing my home. The house was built in 1944 , and we  take pride in maintaining  the history of the home, while expanding and upgrading it over the last 26 years. My 2 boys have grown up here, and done very well. My oldest son is majoring in computer science at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. My younger son is on his way to accepting many offers  from several universities. So I guess I am what you call  and an ""empty nester"". I love  having  people in my home and feel very  lucky to have had wonderful  guests, and I look forward to having more.  It's been an honor to meet people  I would never otherwise have met, had it not been for Airbnb.

 Burbank is a wonderful community that is very safe and friendly. My home is very close to  several motion picture studios  as well as the Burbank Airport, so it is especially convenient for those in the motion picture studio business and related industries. There are also many resources for those  looking for additional business accommodations, such as conference  rooms, event halls and training facilities. I am so fortunate to live in a location  that is also close to  many attractions,  including  theme parks, hiking and biking trails, fantastic  restaurants and great live music. As a longtime Burbank resident, I can say it is  a world  renowned city with a small-town atmosphere. Many of the residents  are 3rd generation and  continue  to stay because of the friendships and wonderful community support. So I can definitely recommend the best the area has to offer!

 I have an art studio in my detached garage where I work, so I am close by but not intrusive if guests would like privacy. I enjoy entertaining and providing  extras for my  guests.  I hope you consider my home  for your stay while you travel.",N/A,N/A,N/A,Burbank,1,5,TRUE,TRUE

It’s so fun to see all the different people and the younger people that get to travel because this makes it much more affordable. I don’t get to see my guests most of the time.  The responses I receive guides me and lets me know what to do and how to improve my places. I love skating at the beach in the morning or the evening.

I grew up between the Mountains of Colorado, in Vail and Aspen, and a large cattle ranch in Northwest Montana.  After a year of school at Prescott College in Arizona and several more shooting ski films in Colorado, I moved to North Hollywood where I lasted about 6 months before fleeing to Half Moon Bay.  I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.  About 10 years ago I met my sweetheart at the Premier of an IMAX Film called ""Mystery of the Nile"" we shot while making the first ""Source to Sea"" descent of the Nile.  After a couple of years living in the Marina we decided to settle in Topanga with our young family.  As luck would have it, we found a magical piece of property, with direct access to over 100 miles of hiking/mountain biking trails through Topanga State Park and adjacent wild areas, while being only 22 miles direct from downtown Los Angeles.  Now I am able to work closer to home and family.  Airbnb along with some beautiful property with stunning views is helping fulfill that dream....
As far as hosting, I would personally like to make everyone who stays with us a lifelong friend but I am also just happy to share a such a beautiful place so close to the city, yet so far away from all the noise and haste!  
If you decide to stay with us, you are welcome to request additional services like breakfast, cappuccino or a shuttle to the airport, direction and information on local resources.

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

My place is inspired by a trip I took to Indonesia- where ironically I stayed in an Air BnB with an amazing host who encouraged me to also host on the site if I ever had the opportunity- so here I am!  The space is a guest house that’s unattached to the main house, in a quiet and very safe neighborhood.  It’s totally enclosed within a backyard with high walls and a locking gate, with ample street parking. (The only restrictions are for street sweeping on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but even then parking is easy).  There is a dog in the front house but hes so cute and friendly and would love to play with you-  if you don’t like dogs I can arrange for him to not be in the yard during your visit. I have a lot of knowledge to offer you about LA and what you should do while you’re here, so feel free to ask!

I live in the NoHo Arts District, in a cute little guest house.  I used to travel a lot for work and have the opportunity to offer my space for rent when I’m away, but now I have been staying in the main house (thanks, Covid) on the property instead, so I’m still able to rent out Little Bali.  My place is inspired by a trip I took to Indonesia- where ironically I stayed in an Air BnB with an amazing host who encouraged me to also host on the site if I ever had the opportunity- so here I am!  The space is a guest house that’s unattached to the main house, in a quiet and very safe neighborhood.  It’s totally enclosed within a backyard with high walls and a locking gate, with ample street parking. (The only restrictions are for street sweeping on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but even then parking is easy).  There is a dog in the front house but hes so cute and friendly and would love to play with you-  if you don’t like dogs I can arrange for him to not be in the yard during your visit. I have a lot of knowledge to offer you about LA and what you should do while you’re here, so feel free to ask!

I gave up my day job to focus on traveling.

I love road trips, it is really the best way to experience whatever area you travel to.  I have taken road trips in four different countries and I hope to experience your country, via road, wherever you are.

Airbnb has given me the wonderful opportunity to provide great times for others.  From the time we connect, to the time we part ways, I get an opportunity to be a part of you having a great experience.  I do aim to please!

I am happy to have several locations near amazing places to visit.  From the ocean, to the desert, to the mountains, you are only 10 to 90 minutes from all of it.  Of course there are major tourist areas like Hollywood, Universal Studios, Disneyland, Sofi Stadium and many more, so come prepared to have a good time!

A relaxing place that's affordable, simple, cozy and very quiet.  

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

I gave up my day job to focus on traveling.

I love road trips, it is really the best way to experience whatever area you travel to.  I have taken road trips in four different countries and I hope to experience your country, via road, wherever you are.

Airbnb has given me the wonderful opportunity to provide great times for others.  From the time we connect, to the time we part ways, I get an opportunity to be a part of you having a great experience.  I do aim to please!

I am happy to have several locations near amazing places to visit.  From the ocean, to the desert, to the mountains, you are only 10 to 90 minutes from all of it.  Of course there are major tourist areas like Hollywood, Universal Studios, Disneyland, Sofi Stadium and many more, so come prepared to have a good time!

All of our guests will experience a professional operation and I treat every guest and property as if it is a 5 star hotel experience.

In addition I will lend the personal knowledge that I have of Los Angeles to make sure everyone's experience is tailored to their wants and needs. 

I have been traveling and hosting using AirBnb for over 10 years now and consider myself a global citizen of world. With over 30 countries visited and staying in some of the best places (and worst), I strive to make peoples experiences as good as I can when visiting my home city of Los Angeles.

My goal is to make every fellow traveler feel at home in the City of Angels. All of our properties are met with the highest standards of cleanliness, decor, linens, FULLY stocked kitchens for cooking, and basic amenities such as spa quality shampoos and soaps.

I grew up on the Motown sound, The Beatles, Elvis, Frank Sinatra & Johnny Mathis.  Currently, I love most rap music and most pop music.  I love Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, Lady Ga Ga, Pink!, Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Adele, Maroon 5, Jay Z and Beyonce, to name a few.  I love my family.  Most of my brothers and sisters live nearby.  Some of my favorite restaurants are Javier's in Century City, The Little Kitchen of Italy in Westchester, Ruth Chris, Killer Shrimp, and of course the always reliable Cheesecake Factory in the Marina!  I guess my motto in life is. . .if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.  I stand for human and equal rights.  Do unto others. . .and we'll all be alright!",within an hour,100%,99%,Inglewood,3,8,TRUE,TRUE

A relaxing place that's affordable, simple, cozy and very quiet.  

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”
~Brenna~

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~

Hi Dary, it's Ariane and Cat. We love your place and have made ourselves at home! Thanks again for having us!

A relaxing place that's affordable, simple, cozy and very quiet.  

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

I'm a mom of two kids who love water parks and Disney World. That is why I run this house. 
Because the water park is in this community, you can choose to cross the bridge from the unit to get there and enjoy the scenery of the lake, by the way, or you can call the club's complimentary shuttle and pick you up directly from the unit to there. Of course, it is also very convenient if you drive by yourself. 1 - 2 minutes to arrive. There are many free entertainment items in the club for you and your family to have fun. 
It's only a 10-minute drive to Disneyland from here, so kids can have fun. It is within 5 minutes from supermarkets such as Walmart and Target and only ten more minutes away from the outlets. There are many delicious dishes around, which is convenient. 
Every detail of this house is a hand laid out by me with my love. I have specially placed sunset lamps and gypsophila atmosphere lamps for everyone to take pictures of. I hope you will leave a good impression on this house! 
I will also offer you a special offer for all the guests who come back for the second time!

The Haas Building is located at 219 West 7th Street, at the corner of Broadway and Seventh Street, in Historic Downtown Los Angeles, California. The building was originally owned by Abraham Haas of San Francisco; president of Haas, Baruch, & Company. The structure was made to be one of the finest and most modern buildings of the time. The building was constructed in the year (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , built with the latest steel frame and absolutely fireproof. Architectural firm Morgan, Walls & Clements designed this 12-story terra cotta business structure attractively facing the street with a frontage of 55 feet (17 m) on Broadway by 150 feet (46 m) on Seventh. The building was 50 by 75 feet (23 m) on the ground floor as well as the basement. The Haas Building was completed early (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) The interior woodwork was made in solid mahogany; the corridors were floored with marble with seven-foot marble wainscoting. The floor, walls and ceiling of the lobby were also made with marble. Including the three high-speed elevators that were installed, fixtures and interiors were said to have cost approximately $ (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ]
The building had been given a complete makeover in the (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) s, with the classic exterior lost to brown metal panels. While much of the exterior brick and detail work was removed, the pieces around the entryway survived, though they were heavily damaged.
The Haas Building has undergone a complete remodel and has 68 live/work lofts. In addition, the top two floors of The Haas Building will be the home of the Haas PH, a multi-functional private event space. The 16,000-square-foot (1,500 m2) space has the feel of a modern boutique hotel with touches of its illustrious 99-year history throughout.

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”
~Brenna~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~

Hi Dary, it's Ariane and Cat. We love your place and have made ourselves at home! Thanks again for having us!

I am extremely easy to talk too and really love meeting new people on my adventures. I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s all over the world and have met some great people on the platform who I now call my friends.

My favourite things in this world are basketball, tennis, and computers (hardware, software, and especially video games). I especially love the outdoors and hiking. Oh, and I can't forget, food! All kinds of food but Malaysian food is my favorite and a must try!

I also have a passion for learning new languages which has come in helpful on my travels. Along with English, I speak some German(highschool level), Cantonese, and Mandarin.

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”
~Brenna~

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~

Hi Dary, it's Ariane and Cat. We love your place and have made ourselves at home! Thanks again for having us!

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~

Hi Dary, it's Ariane and Cat. We love your place and have made ourselves at home! Thanks again for having us!

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”
~Brenna~

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~

We always dreamed to live near the ocean and our dream realized 25 years ago when we purchased this home. Over the years, we put lots of efforts to make it comfortable and unique, filled with good vibes and memories. Like most people who discover Santa Monica, for us, it was love at first sight and we hope it will be the same for you. We have recently retired and, in December 2021, we have opened doors of our home to visitors from all over the world. 

The house will tell you a lot about us. 

We love to travel, and we bring a unique picture frame from every country and place we have visited. Dream with us about your next trip looking at this unique display of images from all over the world. 

We love gardening and you can feel it in our one-of-a-kind, oasis, Zen patio that was inspired by the Bel Air Hotel gardens. It has a mixture of natural greenery and artificial plants to cover hard to grow areas, fountain, multiple décor items and handmade Tiffany lights and lanterns. It is just magic!

We love décor. Each room has its own wall decorative finish, such as Venetian plaster, pearl, handmade stencils, custom tiles and faux paints. 

We hope that you will appreciate our art collection by renowned artists - Herman Gold and Anatoly Zaslavsky. Their works are displayed in many museums in Russia and Ukraine, galleries in France, Greece, Israel, the USA, as well as in private collections around the world. 

We love clean and comfortable home and hope you will as well. We thought about many details to make your stay very enjoyable such as Italian towel warmers, chargers on each nightstand, TV in every room, gourmet kitchen, full office, board games and many more. 

We put our hearts and soul to make our guests feel home away from home. We strive to provide you with an outstanding staying experience, and we look forward to hosting you! Let us know if you need anything, please take good care of our home during your stay and come back soon!

Old:

I'm from New York City.  I spent much of my 20s traveling, but now I am in Manhattan permanently, for now ;-)  I live in the heart of the East Village, I always enjoy meeting new people, and I look forward to sharing my space with you.  I like keeping things clean, taking shoes off at the door, and I have plenty of recommendations for restaurants, activities, shows, museums, etc.

We'll be sharing a 2BR (one BR is mine obviously, and the other is yours + your guests).  The bathroom is nice and clean, I have fresh linens & towels for you, the common area is quite large & comfy, great views of St. Mark's place, and we have a fully stocked kitchen (olive oil, pans, plates, spices, etc.)

I hope to host you soon (or if I am in your city and AirBnB-ing, I hope to enjoy my stay at your place). Thanks for reading!",within a few hours,100%,90%,NA,1,1,TRUE,TRUE

All of our guests will experience a professional operation and I treat every guest and property as if it is a 5 star hotel experience. Professional cleaning crews, quality amenities, 24 hour contact information for myself and team to take care of any needs. In addition I will lend the personal knowledge that I have of Los Angeles to make sure everyone's experience is tailored to their wants and needs. 

I have been traveling and hosting using AirBnb for over 10 years now and consider myself a global citizen of world. With over 30 countries visited and staying in some of the best places (and worst), I strive to make peoples experiences as good as I can when visiting my home city of Los Angeles.

My goal is to make every fellow traveler feel at home in the City of Angels. All of our properties are met with the highest standards of cleanliness, decor, linens, FULLY stocked kitchens for cooking, and basic amenities such as spa quality shampoos and soaps.

I look forward to having you!

All of our guests will experience a professional operation and I treat every guest and property as if it is a 5 star hotel experience. Professional cleaning crews, quality amenities, 24 hour contact information for myself and team to take care of any needs. In addition I will lend the personal knowledge that I have of Los Angeles to make sure everyone's experience is tailored to their wants and needs. 

I have been traveling and hosting using AirBnb for over 10 years now and consider myself a global citizen of world. With over 30 countries visited and staying in some of the best places (and worst), I strive to make peoples experiences as good as I can when visiting my home city of Los Angeles.

My goal is to make every fellow traveler feel at home in the City of Angels. All of our properties are met with the highest standards of cleanliness, decor, linens, FULLY stocked kitchens for cooking, and basic amenities such as spa quality shampoos and soaps.

A relaxing place that's affordable, simple, cozy and very quiet.  

About Your Host:  Hi, I'm Miss very straightforward and direct, in case you can't tell by reading my listings lol.  I have a passion for business, learning new things and helping others.  I am single, no kids except for my Airbnb listings are my babies that's why I gave them names hahaha, and I take good care of them to share with you.  I choose to be HAPPY almost all the time.  I am very honest, ethical and trustworthy.

 I love a good conversation with my guest or just leaving you alone and let you do your thing, unless you are violating my rules then you have to leave. 

MUST READ:

Please take the time to go over the entire profile just one more time.

The Pe'Sha places are NOT Hotels,  I don't charge a cleaning because I wanted to limit my guest cost.  So if you choose to book with me it's mandatory that you clean up behind yourself.  So please treat my place like your own and keep it clean.  The kitchen, the room, bathroom and living room.  The property has basic wear and tear but it's clean and maintained.  Again, it's not a motel/hotel  so if you are looking for immaculate and perfection, this wouldn't be a good fit.  Pe'Sha is simply somewhere to lay your head and do your thing while traveling.

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”
~Brenna~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~

Hi Dary, it's Ariane and Cat. We love your place and have made ourselves at home! Thanks again for having us!

All of our guests will experience a professional operation and I treat every guest and property as if it is a 5 star hotel experience.

In addition I will lend the personal knowledge that I have of Los Angeles to make sure everyone's experience is tailored to their wants and needs. 

I have been traveling and hosting using AirBnb for over 10 years now and consider myself a global citizen of world. With over 30 countries visited and staying in some of the best places (and worst), I strive to make peoples experiences as good as I can when visiting my home city of Los Angeles.

My goal is to make every fellow traveler feel at home in the City of Angels. All of our properties are met with the highest standards of cleanliness, decor, linens, FULLY stocked kitchens for cooking, and basic amenities such as spa quality shampoos and soaps.

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”

We hope this will be your home away from home for you when you stay with us.  Our reviews speak for us:-).

MEET YOUR HOSTS: 

We are an Australian Vietnamese American family of 4 who have been enjoying hosting our guests from all over the world in our homes for 17 years. We have been Airbnb hosts since 2012 and Superhost since the program started. We were also awarded Outstanding Travelers’ Award by other platforms since 2019. Booking guests rated us as high as 9.1/10 and even higher that some five star hotels in the area. We genuinely love people and we are world travelers who believe that hosting and traveling will open people’s hearts, minds & souls and ultimately make the world a better place. 

ABOUT COSTA MESA: Do you know that Costa Mesa is the City of the Art & home for Orange County’s top rated restaurants? It’s a mecca for foodies, adventures seekers and fun loving families. The amenities are top notch and all are within 10-20 minute walk or drive.

LOCATION & PROXIMITY: Our listings are right in the heart of Costa Mesa and Orange County and conveniently located near Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Balboa Island, Corona Del Mar, UCI, Disneyland and the main freeways to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino mountains.

SHARING & PRIVACY:  This is a shared home so we live on the property and we can have multiple guests at one time. All the guests have their private rooms and private spaces as well as access to the two bathrooms and communal areas. Please click on our profile to see our other listings. We also help with co-hosting. 

CLEANLINESS:

As we have multiple guests, two well mannered rambunctious growing boys ( 14 and 11 years old) and a busy schedule, our house won’t be immaculate like a hotel at all times. You will see our personal belongings in the communal areas and in our own rooms. However, you are assured that we make every effort to ensure your rooms are cleaned and made with fresh & crisp bedding & the bathrooms are attended frequently. 

HOMESTAY VS HOTEL EXPECTATIONS:

You will be staying in a Homestay, means that this is our home in which we are renting out private rooms and spaces to our guests so yes, you will be sharing with other people including us the hosts. On average, there will be 4 of us and there may be 3 or 4 more people depending how many are booked in our 2 other rooms and backyard facilities. 

We are attentive and love to ensure our guests needs are met so we will respond to your requests as soon as we are available. If we don’t meet any of your 5 star expectations, please bring to our attention immediately so we can address it sooner than later. We want to be your 5 star hosts, we really do!

If you want your own bathroom, don’t like meeting people or have expectations of a hotel, our place may not be the best fit for you.

If you love meeting people, exploring local attractions, enjoy our hospitality and don’t mind sharing the bathrooms with others, you are in right place:-). 

Looking forward to hosting you!

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”

    Our Malibu Hideaway on 5.5 acres & surrounded by thousands of acres of open space in the canyons allows us to live in the kind of place we used to seek to find balance & happiness. 
    Being able to share our spaces with like-minded folks brings us happiness! We hope it will bring others as much zen & center as it has us. 
    In silence we hear the trees rustle, the owls hoot and the roosters call. In the evenings the stars gleam so bright & the shooting stars light the nights sky. 
    Before living in the “wild” we would often escape the city for the simplicity we often craved. It’s not uncommon here for us to see Bob-cats, hawks, bunnies, squirrels, scorpions, & so many beautiful birds & creatures. At The Casita the sound of coyotes howling in the night sets the tone. 
    We decided to purchase The Desert Casita on 1.18 acres for the same calm nature-rich environment. Our Desert Casita like Malibu Hideaway is a special place to reset and renew the spirit. 
    The desolate energy of the desert offers so much hidden life and mystery! Every time we’ve escaped to the Mojave desert and submerged in her vitality we have always returned renewed, revitalized, and freshly creative. 
    The High desert like Malibu is a special place on earth that we feel utterly grateful to inhabit and share its magic with others. 
    We have a passion for cooking for our friends & family. We also enjoy the finest cuisines from the best restaurants locally & around the world. 
    We’re both culturally diverse through travel to some of the most beautiful places around the world. 
    Angie is an optimistic, free-spirited, artist & realtor California native. Martin, an artsy, musician, incredible chef, agriculturalist, trilingual French native.

We stay mindful of our volume and are intentional about our steps, though you may hear us around the home as you would in shared wall apartments or hotels. We have made every effort to insulate the space.

 We are happy to share our home with travelers looking for a safe, private, cozy, convenient, and welcoming space during their stay, whether it be for work or leisure.

We are both Orange County born and raised. We love to travel and explore the world. We enjoy hiking, long walks, beach bonfires and road trips. We encourage our guests to explore and can provide ample suggestions if asked.

Important to note* Skye, our friendly 10lb Schnoodle, is still learning what Airbnb is, so she may be a little curious about the new smells and sounds. So although most of her day is spent napping inside the house, she may vocally greet you or try to sniff around the perimeter of the privacy screens. She simply just wants to say hi and put a face to the sounds/smells, but has No access to you.

You can expect quick and clear communication, and a very clean, private, and tidy space. We hope to provide you with the most relaxing and stress-free experience!

We hope this will be your home away from home for you when you stay with us.  Our reviews speak for us:-).

MEET YOUR HOSTS: 

We are an Australian Vietnamese American family of 4 who have been enjoying hosting our guests from all over the world in our homes for 17 years. We have been Airbnb hosts since 2012 and Superhost since the program started. We were also awarded Outstanding Travelers’ Award by other platforms since 2019. Booking guests rated us as high as 9.1/10 and even higher that some five star hotels in the area. We genuinely love people and we are world travelers who believe that hosting and traveling will open people’s hearts, minds & souls and ultimately make the world a better place. 

ABOUT COSTA MESA: Do you know that Costa Mesa is the City of the Art & home for Orange County’s top rated restaurants? It’s a mecca for foodies, adventures seekers and fun loving families. The amenities are top notch and all are within 10-20 minute walk or drive.

LOCATION & PROXIMITY: Our listings are right in the heart of Costa Mesa and Orange County and conveniently located near Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Balboa Island, Corona Del Mar, UCI, Disneyland and the main freeways to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino mountains.

SHARING & PRIVACY:  This is a shared home so we live on the property and we can have multiple guests at one time. All the guests have their private rooms and private spaces as well as access to the two bathrooms and communal areas. Please click on our profile to see our other listings. We also help with co-hosting. 

CLEANLINESS:

As we have multiple guests, two well mannered rambunctious growing boys ( 14 and 11 years old) and a busy schedule, our house won’t be immaculate like a hotel at all times. You will see our personal belongings in the communal areas and in our own rooms. However, you are assured that we make every effort to ensure your rooms are cleaned and made with fresh & crisp bedding & the bathrooms are attended frequently. 

HOMESTAY VS HOTEL EXPECTATIONS:

You will be staying in a Homestay, means that this is our home in which we are renting out private rooms and spaces to our guests so yes, you will be sharing with other people including us the hosts. On average, there will be 4 of us and there may be 3 or 4 more people depending how many are booked in our 2 other rooms and backyard facilities. 

We are attentive and love to ensure our guests needs are met so we will respond to your requests as soon as we are available. If we don’t meet any of your 5 star expectations, please bring to our attention immediately so we can address it sooner than later. We want to be your 5 star hosts, we really do!

If you want your own bathroom, don’t like meeting people or have expectations of a hotel, our place may not be the best fit for you.

If you love meeting people, exploring local attractions, enjoy our hospitality and don’t mind sharing the bathrooms with others, you are in right place:-). 

Looking forward to hosting you!

MEET YOUR HOSTS: 

We are an Australian Vietnamese American family of 4 who have been enjoying hosting our guests from all over the world in our homes for 17 years. We have been Airbnb hosts since 2012 and Superhost since the program started. We were also awarded Outstanding Travelers’ Award by other platforms since 2019. Booking guests rated us as high as 9.1/10 and even higher that some five star hotels in the area. We genuinely love people and we are world travelers who believe that hosting and traveling will open people’s hearts, minds & souls and ultimately make the world a better place. 

ABOUT COSTA MESA: Do you know that Costa Mesa is the City of the Art & home for Orange County’s top rated restaurants? It’s a mecca for foodies, adventures seekers and fun loving families. The amenities are top notch and all are within 10-20 minute walk or drive.

LOCATION & PROXIMITY: Our listings are right in the heart of Costa Mesa and Orange County and conveniently located near Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Balboa Island, Corona Del Mar, UCI, Disneyland and the main freeways to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino mountains.

SHARING & PRIVACY:  This is a shared home so we live on the property and we can have multiple guests at one time. All the guests have their private rooms and private spaces as well as access to the two bathrooms and communal areas. Please click on our profile to see our other listings. We also help with co-hosting. 

CLEANLINESS:

As we have multiple guests, two well mannered rambunctious growing boys ( 14 and 11 years old) and a busy schedule, our house won’t be immaculate like a hotel at all times. You will see our personal belongings in the communal areas and in our own rooms. However, you are assured that we make every effort to ensure your rooms are cleaned and made with fresh & crisp bedding & the bathrooms are attended frequently. 

HOMESTAY VS HOTEL EXPECTATIONS:

You will be staying in a Homestay, means that this is our home in which we are renting out private rooms and spaces to our guests so yes, you will be sharing with other people including us the hosts. On average, there will be 4 of us and there may be 3 or 4 more people depending how many are booked in our 2 other rooms and backyard facilities. 

We are attentive and love to ensure our guests needs are met so we will respond to your requests as soon as we are available. If we don’t meet any of your 5 star expectations, please bring to our attention immediately so we can address it sooner than later. We want to be your 5 star hosts, we really do!

If you want your own bathroom, don’t like meeting people or have expectations of a hotel, our place may not be the best fit for you.

If you love meeting people, exploring local attractions, enjoy our hospitality and don’t mind sharing the bathrooms with others, you are in right place:-).

We hope this will be your home away from home for you when you stay with us.  Our reviews speak for us:-).

MEET YOUR HOSTS: 

We are an Australian Vietnamese American family of 4 who have been enjoying hosting our guests from all over the world in our homes for 17 years. We have been Airbnb hosts since 2012 and Superhost since the program started. We were also awarded Outstanding Travelers’ Award by other platforms since 2019. Booking guests rated us as high as 9.1/10 and even higher that some five star hotels in the area. We genuinely love people and we are world travelers who believe that hosting and traveling will open people’s hearts, minds & souls and ultimately make the world a better place. 

ABOUT COSTA MESA: Do you know that Costa Mesa is the City of the Art & home for Orange County’s top rated restaurants? It’s a mecca for foodies, adventures seekers and fun loving families. The amenities are top notch and all are within 10-20 minute walk or drive.

LOCATION & PROXIMITY: Our listings are right in the heart of Costa Mesa and Orange County and conveniently located near Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Balboa Island, Corona Del Mar, UCI, Disneyland and the main freeways to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino mountains.

SHARING & PRIVACY:  This is a shared home so we live on the property and we can have multiple guests at one time. All the guests have their private rooms and private spaces as well as access to the two bathrooms and communal areas. Please click on our profile to see our other listings. We also help with co-hosting. 

CLEANLINESS:

As we have multiple guests, two well mannered rambunctious growing boys ( 14 and 11 years old) and a busy schedule, our house won’t be immaculate like a hotel at all times. You will see our personal belongings in the communal areas and in our own rooms. However, you are assured that we make every effort to ensure your rooms are cleaned and made with fresh & crisp bedding & the bathrooms are attended frequently. 

HOMESTAY VS HOTEL EXPECTATIONS:

You will be staying in a Homestay, means that this is our home in which we are renting out private rooms and spaces to our guests so yes, you will be sharing with other people including us the hosts. On average, there will be 4 of us and there may be 3 or 4 more people depending how many are booked in our 2 other rooms and backyard facilities. 

We are attentive and love to ensure our guests needs are met so we will respond to your requests as soon as we are available. If we don’t meet any of your 5 star expectations, please bring to our attention immediately so we can address it sooner than later. We want to be your 5 star hosts, we really do!

If you want your own bathroom, don’t like meeting people or have expectations of a hotel, our place may not be the best fit for you.

If you love meeting people, exploring local attractions, enjoy our hospitality and don’t mind sharing the bathrooms with others, you are in right place:-). 

Looking forward to hosting you!

We hope this will be your home away from home for you when you stay with us.  Our reviews speak for us:-).

MEET YOUR HOSTS: 

We are an Australian Vietnamese American family of 4 who have been enjoying hosting our guests from all over the world in our homes for 17 years. We have been Airbnb hosts since 2012 and Superhost since the program started. We were also awarded Outstanding Travelers’ Award by other platforms since 2019. Booking guests rated us as high as 9.1/10 and even higher that some five star hotels in the area. We genuinely love people and we are world travelers who believe that hosting and traveling will open people’s hearts, minds & souls and ultimately make the world a better place. 

ABOUT COSTA MESA: Do you know that Costa Mesa is the City of the Art & home for Orange County’s top rated restaurants? It’s a mecca for foodies, adventures seekers and fun loving families. The amenities are top notch and all are within 10-20 minute walk or drive.

LOCATION & PROXIMITY: Our listings are right in the heart of Costa Mesa and Orange County and conveniently located near Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Balboa Island, Corona Del Mar, UCI, Disneyland and the main freeways to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino mountains.

SHARING & PRIVACY:  This is a shared home so we live on the property and we can have multiple guests at one time. All the guests have their private rooms and private spaces as well as access to the two bathrooms and communal areas. Please click on our profile to see our other listings. We also help with co-hosting. 

CLEANLINESS:

As we have multiple guests, two well mannered rambunctious growing boys ( 14 and 11 years old) and a busy schedule, our house won’t be immaculate like a hotel at all times. You will see our personal belongings in the communal areas and in our own rooms. However, you are assured that we make every effort to ensure your rooms are cleaned and made with fresh & crisp bedding & the bathrooms are attended frequently. 

HOMESTAY VS HOTEL EXPECTATIONS:

You will be staying in a Homestay, means that this is our home in which we are renting out private rooms and spaces to our guests so yes, you will be sharing with other people including us the hosts. On average, there will be 4 of us and there may be 3 or 4 more people depending how many are booked in our 2 other rooms and backyard facilities. 

We are attentive and love to ensure our guests needs are met so we will respond to your requests as soon as we are available. If we don’t meet any of your 5 star expectations, please bring to our attention immediately so we can address it sooner than later. We want to be your 5 star hosts, we really do!

If you want your own bathroom, don’t like meeting people or have expectations of a hotel, our place may not be the best fit for you.

If you love meeting people, exploring local attractions, enjoy our hospitality and don’t mind sharing the bathrooms with others, you are in right place:-). 

Looking forward to hosting you!

We hope this will be your home away from home for you when you stay with us.  Our reviews speak for us:-).

MEET YOUR HOSTS: 

We are an Australian Vietnamese American family of 4 who have been enjoying hosting our guests from all over the world in our homes for 17 years. We have been Airbnb hosts since 2012 and Superhost since the program started. We were also awarded Outstanding Travelers’ Award by other platforms since 2019. Booking guests rated us as high as 9.1/10 and even higher that some five star hotels in the area. We genuinely love people and we are world travelers who believe that hosting and traveling will open people’s hearts, minds & souls and ultimately make the world a better place. 

ABOUT COSTA MESA: Do you know that Costa Mesa is the City of the Art & home for Orange County’s top rated restaurants? It’s a mecca for foodies, adventures seekers and fun loving families. The amenities are top notch and all are within 10-20 minute walk or drive.

LOCATION & PROXIMITY: Our listings are right in the heart of Costa Mesa and Orange County and conveniently located near Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Balboa Island, Corona Del Mar, UCI, Disneyland and the main freeways to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino mountains.

SHARING & PRIVACY:  This is a shared home so we live on the property and we can have multiple guests at one time. All the guests have their private rooms and private spaces as well as access to the two bathrooms and communal areas. Please click on our profile to see our other listings. We also help with co-hosting. 

CLEANLINESS:

As we have multiple guests, two well mannered rambunctious growing boys ( 14 and 11 years old) and a busy schedule, our house won’t be immaculate like a hotel at all times. You will see our personal belongings in the communal areas and in our own rooms. However, you are assured that we make every effort to ensure your rooms are cleaned and made with fresh & crisp bedding & the bathrooms are attended frequently. 

HOMESTAY VS HOTEL EXPECTATIONS:

You will be staying in a Homestay, means that this is our home in which we are renting out private rooms and spaces to our guests so yes, you will be sharing with other people including us the hosts. On average, there will be 4 of us and there may be 3 or 4 more people depending how many are booked in our 2 other rooms and backyard facilities. 

We are attentive and love to ensure our guests needs are met so we will respond to your requests as soon as we are available. If we don’t meet any of your 5 star expectations, please bring to our attention immediately so we can address it sooner than later. We want to be your 5 star hosts, we really do!

If you want your own bathroom, don’t like meeting people or have expectations of a hotel, our place may not be the best fit for you.

If you love meeting people, exploring local attractions, enjoy our hospitality and don’t mind sharing the bathrooms with others, you are in right place:-). 

Looking forward to hosting you!

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”
~Brenna~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”
~ David ~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”
~ Hilke ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi Dary, it's Ariane and Cat. We love your place and have made ourselves at home! Thanks again for having us!
